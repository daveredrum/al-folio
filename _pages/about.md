Hey there! I'm Dave Zhenyu Chen (in Chinese: 陈振宇).

I'm currently a PhD candidate at <a href="http://niessnerlab.org/" target="_blank">TUM Visual Computing Group</a>. My interests are in the intersection between Deep Learning, 3D Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. More specifically:
<ul>
  <li>3D scene understanding;</li>
  <li>Grounding natural language in 3D environments;</li>
  <li>Text-to-3D synthesis.</li>
</ul>

I've been researching full-time at <a href="http://niessnerlab.org/" target="_blank"> Prof. Matthias Nießner's</a> Visual Computing Group at the Technical University of Munich for the past 4 years. I also have a close research collaboration with <a href="https://angelxuanchang.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Angel Chang</a> at Simon Fraser University, Canada.

Prior to the PhD, I received my Master's Degree in Informatics at <a href="https://www.ifi.lmu.de/" target="_blank">Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich (LMU)</a>.
